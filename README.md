Ask a home buyer to describe their dream house, and they probably won't begin with the height of the basement ceiling or the proximity to an east-west railroad. But this playground competition's dataset proves that much more influences price negotiations than the number of bedrooms or a white-picket fence.

With 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa, this competition challenges you to predict the final price of each home.

## üîç ABOUT THIS PROJECT

  The aim of this project is to analyze a dataset in order to develop a machine learning model and predict house's sale price.
  The dataset is available in a "Getting Started Competition" in Kaggle (link available above).
  
  With 79 variables, the maint point was selecting which were the most important caracteristics to build our Machine Learning Model. I've been through data analysis, worked with null values, features select and engineering.
  
  The final Machine Learning model was Random Forest Regressor, despite i've trained Simple Linear Regression, Linear Regression Regularized, XGBoost Regressor and some more. All these models were trained with cross validation technique for the purpose of avoiding overfitting.
